# CS-370-projects
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This is a treasure hunt game. I had to code an agent to find the treasure before an NPC. The code that was given is the game setup code that comprised of GameExperience.pyand TreasureMaze.py.I created the code that includes the reinforcement learning algorithm, which I created thegame loops that utilize the Keras and Tensorflow libraries in order to accomplish thepathfinding solution.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists help solve and identify complex problems with technology inadvanced ways. They also create new technology. Why does it matter well everyone love a VR and that was created by a computer scientist and made possible. It matter because without this our world will stay stagnent we need people to create new things.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approached this problem as a computer scientist with a technical mindset by using myknowledge and resources that were given to solve this problem efficiently.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists have ethical obligations to the end user and the organization inaccomplishing their responsibilities. Taking this course has changed my understanding asa developer of machine learning about the ethical responsibilities to both the end user andcustomer.
